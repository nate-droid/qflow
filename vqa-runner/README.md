# VQA-runner

This directory is used to run various VQA/VQE experiments.

Right now, this directory hasn't been optimized to run in containers, so is only really testable via the `cargo test` command.
Once the operator structure has settled down a bit, I will spend some time making the runners a bit smoother and kube friendly.

NB: I'll need to rename this, as I've added initial support for Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBM) experiments.

# Concepts

## Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA)

Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) are a class of quantum algorithms that use a parameterized quantum circuit to
approximate a solution to a problem. They are often used for optimization tasks, where the goal is to find the optimal 
parameters for the quantum circuit that minimize or maximize a cost function.

## QCBM

Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBM) are a type of generative model that uses quantum circuits to sample from a 
probability distribution. This directory contains the initial implementation of QCBM experiments. This QCBM 
implementation uses custom implementations of ADAM and MMD to optimize the parameters of the quantum circuit (more on 
those below). (Pennylane on QCBMs)[https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qcbm]

## ADAM 

ADAM is an optimization algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning. It is an adaptive learning rate method that
combines the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp. In the context of VQA,

ADAM is used to optimize the parameters of the quantum circuit to minimize the cost function.

## MMD

Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a statistical test used to compare two probability distributions. It is often used in
the context of generative models to evaluate the quality of the samples generated by the model. In the context of VQA, 
MMD is used to compare the samples generated by the quantum circuit with the samples from a classical distribution to 
evaluate the performance of the quantum circuit.

It works be embedding the distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and then computing the distance between the
two distributions in that space. The MMD is defined as the distance between the means of the two distributions in the RKHS.

Since it is non-parametric, it can be used to compare distributions without making any assumptions about their form.
